                    <h3>Art</h3>
                    <p>Ever since I could hold a crayon, I have been drawing.
                            I littered the refridgerators of both parents and grandparents with my creations.
                            I started doing some art for a profession in my early teens and into my twenties. 
                            I started using alchohol markers
                            and never went back to other media. I fell in love with them.
                            This is my first drawing with the Copic markers.

                    <h3>Cooking</h3>
                    <p>In my youth I was a very picky eater. One day in exasperation at the level of my pickiness,
                            my mother suggested I make my own food. 
                            I don't think she expected me to take her words literally,
                            but I have been cooking and baking ever since. 
                            I love watching shows, dining in restaurants, and reading
                            books for inspiration. I thouroughly enjoy making food for others as well as myself. 
                            Some of my favorite meals to prepare are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Breakfast</li>

                                <li>Polenta, Mushrooms, Poached Eggs, and Marinara</li>

                                <li>Chicken Tikka Masala, Forbidden Rice, and Garlic Cheese Naan</li>

                    <h3>Gardening</h3>
                    <p>My most recent hobbies stems (no pun intended) from my love of food. 
                            I wanted to try growing my own veggies and herbs.
                            I started with some transplants from the farmers' market.
                            I babied them and hovered over them with the 
                            enthusiasm and fear of a helicopter parent. 
                            They grew a little bit, but as soon as I stepped away, they blossomed and pretty soon
                            I could not get them to stop!
                            The second year, I grew them all from seed. 
                            What started like this: <br><img src="C:\Users\Vivienne\lc101\html-me-something\images\Zuchs.jpg" height="400"> <br>
                            quickly became this: <br><img src="C:\Users\Vivienne\lc101\html-me-something\images\ZuchandArm.jpg" height="400"><br>
                            <br>I've now grown many varieties of tomatoes, hot and sweet peppers, 
                            corn, beans, cabbages, basils, mints, rosemary, zucchinis, and gourds. 
                            And the produce gets to used thanks to my second hobby of cooking. Yum, Zucchini Fries!
